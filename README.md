# Weather App

Hi ! I've just made my first weather-app application using React & Redux to practisethose technologies.

Implemented solutions

 1. Day forecast displayed in grid view
 2. Weather data fetched from open weather API
 3. Possibility to search for any city
 4. Current weather
 
## How it works

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

The only thing to run application is to instal node modules by typing "npm install" in console. Then start application by typing "npm start" in console.

### How did I create this project?
